# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `~/.config/chopsticks.vim` local pre-load config for profile and user choices
- `g:chopsticks_enable_markdown_preview` to control Previm independently
- `g:chopsticks_profile` with `minimal`, `engineer`, and `full` profiles
- `.markdownlint.json` aligned with the project's README/changelog style
- `:ChopsticksStatus` diagnostic command — checks system tools, LSP servers, linters, formatters
- `,af` toggle format-on-save (ALE `fix_on_save`)
- `,gL` git log graph (last 20 commits)
- `,gC` FZF git commits search, `,gB` buffer commits
- Interactive installer profile selection for `minimal`, `engineer`, and `full`
- `install.sh --profile=minimal|engineer|full` for scripted profile selection
- `install.sh --dry-run` to show the resolved profile/config path without writes
- `install.sh --configure-only` to update local profile config without reinstalling

### Fixed

- `g:loaded_logipat` typo → `g:loaded_logiPat` — logiPat was loading fully (0.478ms wasted)
- `get.sh` now refuses to update an existing `~/.vim` git repo unless its
  origin is chopsticks
- Large file protection now stays active after filetype and syntax autocommands
- `g:ale_fix_on_save = 0` in local config is now respected
- Local config now respects absolute `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` instead of hardcoding
  `~/.config`

### Changed

- `,?` cheat sheet is now profile-aware and hides LSP/ALE/preview/UndoTree keys
  when those features are disabled
- Module reload/source paths now use `fnameescape()` so installs in paths with
  spaces are handled correctly
- CI now verifies path-safe module loading, the local config hook, and
  minimal-profile cheat sheet output
- Markdown now opens in quiet writing mode by default: no real-time markdownlint,
  no Marksman LSP, no spell noise, no conceal, no sign column, and no realtime preview
- Native `s` is no longer shadowed by EasyMotion; use `,S` for the two-character jump
- `,w` now uses a normal `:write` instead of forced `:write!`
- Swap files are enabled again and stored under `~/.vim/.swap` for crash recovery
- Installer defaults are slimmer: only core search tools stay selected by default;
  language and lint suites are opt-in
- `:ChopsticksStatus` now respects disabled LSP/lint profiles instead of reporting
  intentionally disabled tools as missing
- `,sv` now clears the load guard before sourcing `$MYVIMRC`
- CI now verifies key plugin directories, Markdown quiet defaults, markdownlint,
  and an explicit startup-time threshold
- Installer plugin validation now checks every plugin required by the active profile
- The optional tool menu now hides LSP/lint suites in `minimal` and selects
  Marksman by default in `full`
- tmux integration is written as a managed block so future installer runs can
  update it without appending duplicate bindings
- Installer cleanup now restores the cursor after interrupted checkbox menus
- Skip 2 more built-in plugins: openPlugin, manpager (10 → 12 total)
- Remove deprecated `set ttyfast` (no-op since Vim 8)
- Add `grepprg=rg --vimgrep` — `:grep` now uses ripgrep + quickfix
- Add `diffopt` with histogram algorithm and indent-heuristic
- Consolidate FZF Rg/RgWord/GFiles commands (DRY refactor)
- vim-tmux-navigator: conditional load (only inside tmux), fallback `Ctrl+hjkl` mappings outside
- Add `Ctrl+hjkl` window navigation fallback when tmux-navigator not loaded
